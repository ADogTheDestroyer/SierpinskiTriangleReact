# SierpinskiTriangleReact
I am very excited to have completed my very first react application. I saw a video online of a very interesting, yet short algorithm that when repeated enough times, it creates Sierpinski's triangle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgu5-3ihVVI

### Setup
1. Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/ADogTheDestroyer/SierpinskiTriangleReact.git```

2. Install all dependencies with ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` (from inside the repository folder)

3. Now you're good to go and run ```npm start``` to run the application. It will take a few seconds, but a window should pop up in your browser. If it doesn't, type ```http://localhost:3000/``` in the search bar of your browser.

4. Start trying increasingly larger numbers to see Sierpinski's triangle form. I recommend staying below 25000 dots.

### Looking for advice and constructive criticism
As I mentioned, this is my first go at a React. Please let me know what was good, and more importantly was wasn't so good about my implementation, along with ways I should improve it, and ideas of how I should expand with it :) Happy coding everyone
